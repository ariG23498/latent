# Hi, I'm Aakash Nain.
I am a Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience in the industry. Currently, I am working as a **Senior Data Scientist** at [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai/). I am one of the maintainers of the **[TensorFlow-addons](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons)** package. I am also a **Google Developers Expert** in Machine Learning, and the **first [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html) GDE**. I am an active [Keras](https://keras.io) contributor, and I have contributed code examples like [OCR model for reading captchas](https://keras.io/examples/vision/captcha_ocr/), [Handwriting recognition](https://keras.io/examples/vision/handwriting_recognition/), [Image captioning](https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_captioning/), [WGAN-GP](https://keras.io/examples/generative/wgan_gp/), and [CycleGAN](https://keras.io/examples/generative/cyclegan/)

In terms of work, my knowledge in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning spans in **T-shape**. Though I have worked in multiple domains, Computer Vision with Deep Learning is my favorite field to work with. I love simplifying Data Science and Machine Learning concepts, especially the maths behind them. I try to remain updated with the latest research as much as possible. I read a lot of papers, annotate them, and implement them. Check out the **Resources** section above for educational stuff. 

*Python in breakfast, Machine Learning in lunch, and Deep Learning in dinner!*
